# Todos for PolyChaos.jl

## High priority
  - moments of order greater than 2 in `polynomial_chaos.jl` (needs `IterTools` for an elegant solution)
  - sampling (`polynomial_chaos.jl`)
    - rejection sampling
    - inverse CDF
  - plotting
  - gamma distribution needs to be double checked â†’ construction of basis for feasible rates other than 1
  - code generation for random linear ODEs

## Low priority
  - orthonormal polynomials
  - arbitrary polynomials
